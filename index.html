        To my beautiful sweet person who’s got my heart,
    </p>
        <p class="sentence">
            We know that we’re still not halfway through the year-end however, 
       
            I feel like we’ve known each other for so long and I wouldn’t deny that everything around me made me feel longing for you. It can be frustrating sometimes because we still can’t meet each other. 
            Don’t worry, it gets me better. It just shows how much I’am missing you always. Nothing can be compared to that, not even the universe and galaxies. 
            You are my first to everything. You’re the first who I want to have my first kiss. You’re the first person who I want to pull closer to me until there are no spaces between us. 
            You’re the first gorgeous person who makes my life turn upside-up. You’re the first kind-hearted woman who gives me reassurance. 
            You’re the first person who lets me be who I am. You are my first one of a kind who makes me feel different things. 
            And I’m hoping that you’re also going to be my last to everything and be the one to end me. 
            There wasn’t a time where I doubted my feelings and decisions, as long as you are here in my beating heart because it is a hopeless romantic when it comes to you. I will be with you in every steps you take, whether it’s risky or not. 
            Let me be your number one supporter in every decisions you make. Let me be your person who you can come to, whenever you’re having your darkest nights. 
            Let me be your bestfriend who you can talk to, about everything of you, about your life. Let me be your listener who will pay attentively when you’re sharing your experiences and moments. 
            Let me be your guidance whenever you’re having second thoughts about anything. Let me be with you in your life as you’re now in mine’s. 
            I know that you may think that these are too much to ask for and I won’t force you. But I will wait for you and i’ll be patient with you, longer than you’ll expect. 
            Hold onto me for as long as you want. Until I can fully mend your wounds and you’ll show to the world how successful and happy you are. 
            <br>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">When that time comes, I’ll be the proudest person who have watched over you. I’m always here.</p>
            <br>
            Happiest Valentine’s day to you who I can call as my “all’s well that ends well”. I wish you a very good day.
            <p class="lea">Your Lea.</p>
